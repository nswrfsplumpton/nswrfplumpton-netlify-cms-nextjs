For the first time in the 2020/21 Fire Season, Greater Sydney will tomorrow experience Very High Fire Danger.

Hot and dry conditions mean fires may be difficult to control.

Remember to report any fires without a fire truck in attendance to Triple Zero (000) and download Fires Near Me to stay up to date. ![ðŸ”¥](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ta9/1.5/16/1f525.png)![ðŸš’](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tc0/1.5/16/1f692.png)
